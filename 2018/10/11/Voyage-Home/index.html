        <p>I landed in New Zealand on November 26th 2017. Started my adventure in a country different from where I was born and lived for 36 years.</p>
<p>It was not a hard decision for me, personally, to come here. But it was a hard decision for my family.</p>
<p>I was an IT specialist in IBM, plus a manager in charge of a team about 25 members. It seems everything looks OK for me, an average guy with an average salary, got a below average apartment. But, due to my pessimistic view in life, I got a strong feeling of middle-age crisis. Been working in IBM for more than 7 years, failed some external interviews for potential jumps, I realized that the ultimate capability of survival need be examed in the open market. The team, position, resource and network in IBM are temporary. Due to the model that IBM GBS works, and the increasing labour cost in China, the business model won’t last forever, especially for the department I was working in. The capability of survival and be competitive need be examed globally. That’s why I started looking outside of IBM China since 2016. And by late 2017, I got the opportunity to work in New Zealand, while still under the IBM umbrella.</p>
<p>But the opportunity was just to work for a specific project, I need to return to China once the project finished. And initially, it was expected to be 8 months only. I could not move the whole family to New Zealand with the 8 months assignment, as my wife got her own career, or job that she won’t quit for my 8 months assignment. I could not bring my 6-year-old son on my own, It was obvious that I won’t be able to take care of him while working fulltime in a totally new environment. Which means if I want to go, I have to go alone, leaving my wife, a full-time doctor, to take care of the 6-year-old boy. It was a tough decision for the family, for my wife and my son, although I did not ask for his consent.</p>
<p>With all the support and trust of my wife, I decided and managed to take the step, a forward-only step. That’s why I’m sitting here writing my story of Voyage. the voyage is not for my journey of New Zealand, it’s for something else.</p>
<p>I left home Nov 25 2017, a lot of things happened, but most of them are not important for this story, until a couple of months before my assignment end.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday, after a couple of whisky with my Chinese landlord, who is a nice guy and could potentially be described in another story, We had a coffee around 7 PM and I went to bed, not for sleep. while browsing information from the internet, I found, in New Zealand, it’s possible to buy an old yacht, an 8–12 meter affordable one, and then you can sail around the world, even the yacht could be 30-40 years old. Especially when you work as a senior IT specialist in New Zealand, you could really settle the family with a few years, and then you should have the possibility (time and money) to sail around the world. Which would almost not possible to achieve in China, as an IT guy, an average one(yes, an average IT guy in China could be a senior one in New Zealand — don’t tell any Kiwi I said so). I came into numerous ideas about how to make it happen, although I forgot most of them already. The only thing I remembered about that night was, from 7 PM till 7 AM the next day, I did not sleep a single minute, the coffee could be one of the causes, but I think the major factor is the exiting idea of sailing around the world.</p>
<p>Knowing the possibility of sailing around the world is not just about buying a boat and learn to sail it. It gives me a purpose for my life. I always think about what’s the meaning of life, more specifically, my life. I could not get the answer, the only thing that I could understand was the meaning of life is the journey of life itself, which means to maximize the meaning of my life, is to maximize my experience of life, visit as many places as you can, try as many food as you can, meet as many people as you can. This belief of the meaning of life, do influence how I make my decisions. But it does not give my life a vision, which I realized, at age around 40, it’s essential for everyone, especially for people from China like me do not have religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Vision, sometimes known as a dream, is more than a dream, as long as it leads to actions in reality. And the reality for me is I only have a few months visa for staying in New Zealand, to be able to settle the family and then chase the dream, I need to have the capability to stay longer decently, which ultimately means I need get a job, long term one.</p>
<p>Back to the initial decision to come to New Zealand, It was already part of my plan to get the New Zealand PR if possible. There was a lot of debate about whether the family should pursuing moving to New Zealand permanently, while China might have a more promising future, financially at least. But getting a PR, if possible, was fully agreed in the family discussion. Having a vision of sailing around the world, which consistent with my understanding of the meaning of life, is the best thing I got from New Zealand, it also changed my plan from getting PR if possible to “get the PR”. And the only way for me to get the PR is to get a longer employment in New Zealand, inside or outside of IBM. I started trying some external positions a few months before the planned end date of my assignment, unfortunately, none of them worked out. Which did not really surprise me, although it did hurt my confidence a little bit, as I knew it’s not easy to get a job in the New Zealand market.</p>
<p>Having my confidence hurt by failed interviews, I realized that I need to refresh my knowledge and skill, so I can survive and be competitive in NZ IT market. The best way to gain knowledge would be applying it in daily work, but most of the time you got trapped by the knowledge you apply in daily work, rather than gain new ones. Thus after reading hundreds of job positions, I listed technics that required by the market and suit my background, and decided to start a POC programme to cover the listed technics as much as possible, as my learning practice. also could potentially become my stories for future interviews. And the name of the programme is — Voyage, for my dream of sailing around the world. The outcome of the Voyage will be a series of articles about the technics I learned, for the purpose of sharing and also to exam my understanding of the technic, as you must have sufficient understanding before you can write an article about it.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to weigh the anchor!</p>
