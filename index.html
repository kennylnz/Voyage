        <p>Welcome the first technical article of the Voyage programme. Today, let’s talk about Node.js and Mongo DB. </p>
<h2 id="Node-js"><a href="#Node-js" class="headerlink" title="Node.js"></a>Node.js</h2><p>Node.js provide javascript the capability to be a backend language, and a very good one. Unlike the java language’s dependency and package management mechanism evolved from ant, maven, graddle, Node.js have the npm as package managemer from day 1, and it’s very handy and easy to use. Which makes node.js very easy to start.</p>
<h3 id="Guides"><a href="#Guides" class="headerlink" title="Guides"></a>Guides</h3><p>Best documentation so far I found is the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offical documentation</a>, which has very nice start up <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guides</a>.<br>Although I got most of the knowledge from the website above, I still want to write some words about my understanding, it can also served as appetizer before you dive in to the official documentations.</p>
<h4 id="Development-tools"><a href="#Development-tools" class="headerlink" title="Development tools."></a>Development tools.</h4><p>In my early days of java programming, javascript was embed in JSP to do some UI side logic, like validation, alerts etc. In those days javascript was not considered a real programming language. You don’t have a dedicated IDE ( although you don’t really need one), there is no way to debug ( I used to alert step by step to debug). But these days, javascript has been well developed that it’s almost de facto standard language for front end, node.js makes it a very handy backend language. You got debug tool that naturally ready for remote debug. you can even profiling the node.js process for performance tuning, and containerizing. Because it’s new, it stands on the shoulder of old ones, it has all the goodies built in naturally, while avoiding designs that proved by the old ones to be bad.</p>
<h4 id="Call-backs"><a href="#Call-backs" class="headerlink" title="Call backs."></a>Call backs.</h4><p>Because javascipt is a scripting language, it allows functions to be passed as parameter. Which enables call-back mechanism.  Call-back is one of the ways to achieve IoC, which used to decouple between different models. Java rely on Spring for the same purpose.<br><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">app.use(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">err, req, res, next</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    res.status(err.status || <span class="number">500</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    res.render(<span class="string">'error'</span>, &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        message: err.message,</span><br><span class="line">        error: err</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>From coding perspective, the call-back style is the biggest difference I feel comparing to Java. it’s not just about how you type the code, it actually requires different way of logic think, in Java(and many other language) you write code line by line, and expecting it runs from top to bottom, like flow.  With call-back style, it’s more OO, basically you operate on objects, and assign new feature to an object by just passing certain function as parameter, which requires you not think programming as code line by line, you should think in objects and behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="Mongo-DB"><a href="#Mongo-DB" class="headerlink" title="Mongo DB"></a>Mongo DB</h2><p>Mongo got different titles, No-SQL, document DB, Object DB. I would prefer to consider it as a JSON db.<br>Database, as core backend for any application, can be a very big topic. I would rather leave it to DBAs, I’m a programmer, so I’m not going talk much about the DB part of it. What I would like to say is, just couple of days ago, I heard that there is a system has been running for more than 30 years, serving millions citizen of New Zealand. And the system was built one something called IMS, if you google it, you will find “The IMS Database component stores data using a hierarchical model.”. This hierarchical model, fundamentally, is the same model like JSON, although IMS might store things in binary, but JSON store it in string. This brings me the question that why javascript is prosperous these days, while IMS is sunsetting. If you compare IMS with modern technology, you probably will found IMS does better than modern ones in many aspect, in terms of stability, transactional, data integrity, performance. Then why there are less and less users? I think it could be caused by<br>1 IMS as an IBM product, it’s not open enough, that customer used to pay huge amount of money to service providers. It seems it was the way how technical companies make money.<br>2 Technically, the system might be powerful, but it might not friendly for both developer and user.  Does this mean usability could be the most important factor for whether a system can succeed or not?</p>
<h2 id="Dockerize"><a href="#Dockerize" class="headerlink" title="Dockerize"></a>Dockerize</h2><p>### </p>

        <p>Principles for the Voyage programme</p>
<p>As the idea of Voyage is to learn and practice a bunch of technics and write notes about it, it’s better to have some principles amount all the practice and articles, so they serve the same purpose under the programme.</p>
<p>I have come with a general purpose of the whole programme that it helps me to gain in-depth (enough) understanding of the technics. If possible it should also help anyone who reads the articles as well.</p>
<p>Some common challenges when you start learning at new technics are:</p>
<p>1 It might easy to understand the general idea of the new technics, but not in-depth enough for you to start using it in projects.</p>
<p>2 the best way to solve the point one is to practice, but it actually brings an even bigger challenge, to sort out the environment and make it work as told by many 15 minutes tutorials from the internet.</p>
<p>3 Many tutorials from the internet were based on a certain environment and certain version of tools, which makes the tutorial not workable after a couple of years.</p>
<p>4 Information got from the internet about new technics are small pieces, sometimes it will just a few lines of commands or code, without telling why. Which you don’t really learn from it, you barely solved an incident with a workaround, if you are lucky enough that found the piece you need.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>N, You need to go fishing this weekend, and need prepare the tackle tonight.</p>
<p>N+1, Your 10-year-old machine just doesn’t work for the gigantic software.</p>
<p>There could be a hundred reason that you gave up or stopped before you really learnt the truth of a certain technic.</p>
<p>To help myself and potential readers to embrace the challenges, I came up with following principles for the programme.</p>
<p>Practice perspective:</p>
<p>1 Make the practice have least dependent on environment, by adopting any possible means like virtualizing, containerizing, scripting…</p>
<p>2 Address most core concept and component only, with reasonable enough depth.</p>
<p>3 Examples should be runnable within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Article perspective:</p>
<p>1 Only cover one main component in each article.</p>
<p>2 Maximize the life of the content of the article.</p>
<p>3 Keep improving the English language, so the article is short but clear.</p>

        <p>I landed in New Zealand on November 26th 2017. Started my adventure in a country different from where I was born and lived for 36 years.</p>
<p>It was not a hard decision for me, personally, to come here. But it was a hard decision for my family.</p>
<p>I was an IT specialist in IBM, plus a manager in charge of a team about 25 members. It seems everything looks OK for me, an average guy with an average salary, got a below average apartment. But, due to my pessimistic view in life, I got a strong feeling of middle-age crisis. Been working in IBM for more than 7 years, failed some external interviews for potential jumps, I realized that the ultimate capability of survival need be examed in the open market. The team, position, resource and network in IBM are temporary. Due to the model that IBM GBS works, and the increasing labour cost in China, the business model won’t last forever, especially for the department I was working in. The capability of survival and be competitive need be examed globally. That’s why I started looking outside of IBM China since 2016. And by late 2017, I got the opportunity to work in New Zealand, while still under the IBM umbrella.</p>
<p>But the opportunity was just to work for a specific project, I need to return to China once the project finished. And initially, it was expected to be 8 months only. I could not move the whole family to New Zealand with the 8 months assignment, as my wife got her own career, or job that she won’t quit for my 8 months assignment. I could not bring my 6-year-old son on my own, It was obvious that I won’t be able to take care of him while working fulltime in a totally new environment. Which means if I want to go, I have to go alone, leaving my wife, a full-time doctor, to take care of the 6-year-old boy. It was a tough decision for the family, for my wife and my son, although I did not ask for his consent.</p>
<p>With all the support and trust of my wife, I decided and managed to take the step, a forward-only step. That’s why I’m sitting here writing my story of Voyage. the voyage is not for my journey of New Zealand, it’s for something else.</p>
<p>I left home Nov 25 2017, a lot of things happened, but most of them are not important for this story, until a couple of months before my assignment end.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday, after a couple of whisky with my Chinese landlord, who is a nice guy and could potentially be described in another story, We had a coffee around 7 PM and I went to bed, not for sleep. while browsing information from the internet, I found, in New Zealand, it’s possible to buy an old yacht, an 8–12 meter affordable one, and then you can sail around the world, even the yacht could be 30-40 years old. Especially when you work as a senior IT specialist in New Zealand, you could really settle the family with a few years, and then you should have the possibility (time and money) to sail around the world. Which would almost not possible to achieve in China, as an IT guy, an average one(yes, an average IT guy in China could be a senior one in New Zealand — don’t tell any Kiwi I said so). I came into numerous ideas about how to make it happen, although I forgot most of them already. The only thing I remembered about that night was, from 7 PM till 7 AM the next day, I did not sleep a single minute, the coffee could be one of the causes, but I think the major factor is the exiting idea of sailing around the world.</p>
<p>Knowing the possibility of sailing around the world is not just about buying a boat and learn to sail it. It gives me a purpose for my life. I always think about what’s the meaning of life, more specifically, my life. I could not get the answer, the only thing that I could understand was the meaning of life is the journey of life itself, which means to maximize the meaning of my life, is to maximize my experience of life, visit as many places as you can, try as many food as you can, meet as many people as you can. This belief of the meaning of life, do influence how I make my decisions. But it does not give my life a vision, which I realized, at age around 40, it’s essential for everyone, especially for people from China like me do not have religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Vision, sometimes known as a dream, is more than a dream, as long as it leads to actions in reality. And the reality for me is I only have a few months visa for staying in New Zealand, to be able to settle the family and then chase the dream, I need to have the capability to stay longer decently, which ultimately means I need get a job, long term one.</p>
<p>Back to the initial decision to come to New Zealand, It was already part of my plan to get the New Zealand PR if possible. There was a lot of debate about whether the family should pursuing moving to New Zealand permanently, while China might have a more promising future, financially at least. But getting a PR, if possible, was fully agreed in the family discussion. Having a vision of sailing around the world, which consistent with my understanding of the meaning of life, is the best thing I got from New Zealand, it also changed my plan from getting PR if possible to “get the PR”. And the only way for me to get the PR is to get a longer employment in New Zealand, inside or outside of IBM. I started trying some external positions a few months before the planned end date of my assignment, unfortunately, none of them worked out. Which did not really surprise me, although it did hurt my confidence a little bit, as I knew it’s not easy to get a job in the New Zealand market.</p>
<p>Having my confidence hurt by failed interviews, I realized that I need to refresh my knowledge and skill, so I can survive and be competitive in NZ IT market. The best way to gain knowledge would be applying it in daily work, but most of the time you got trapped by the knowledge you apply in daily work, rather than gain new ones. Thus after reading hundreds of job positions, I listed technics that required by the market and suit my background, and decided to start a POC programme to cover the listed technics as much as possible, as my learning practice. also could potentially become my stories for future interviews. And the name of the programme is — Voyage, for my dream of sailing around the world. The outcome of the Voyage will be a series of articles about the technics I learned, for the purpose of sharing and also to exam my understanding of the technic, as you must have sufficient understanding before you can write an article about it.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to weigh the anchor!</p>
